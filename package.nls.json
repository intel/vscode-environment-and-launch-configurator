    "capabilities.ONEAPI_ROOT.description" : "Absolute path to oneAPI installation folder.\n\nSpecifies the absolute pathname to your oneAPI installation. This path is useful if the oneAPI environment extension is unable to automatically locate your oneAPI setvars script. This is most likely to happen if you have customized the location of your oneAPI install. Note that, by default, this setting only applies if the automatic search for the oneAPI setvars script fails.\n\n",
    "capabilities.SETVARS_CONFIG.description": "Name of a custom setvars configuration file.\n\nSpecify the name of a setvars configuration file. The oneAPI setvars environment setup script normally initializes the 'latest' version of each installed oneAPI component (tools and libraries). This default behavior can be overridden by way of a 'setvars config file'. If no pathname is specified (only a filename is provided) the config file is assumed to be located in the ${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/ directory; otherwise, if a pathname+filename is provided the config file will be located as named.\nRead more about this feature for [Linux and macOS](https://software.intel.com/) and for [Windows](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/).\n"
